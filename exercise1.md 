CI/CD tools:

- TeamCity - Selfhosted and cloud
- AWS CodePipeline - Cloud
- Bamboo
- GitLab CI/CD - Selfhosted and cloud
- CircleCI
- Travis CI
- IBM UrbanCode 
- Buildkite
- Bitrise

Some CI/CD tools can be self-hosted (for example Jenkins, Gitlab and TeamCity). The choice between choosing cloud vs. self-hosted is mainly a choice between more work in addition to developing and being in control of your own systems and data.
Self-hosting entails infrastructure management (server hardware, hypervisors, software, backups, etc.).
A cloud provider that curently feels like a good choice might change for the worse in the future and there's a risk of platform lock-in due to overreliance on proprietary services.
For small projects/teams a cloud solution might be more cost effective.
